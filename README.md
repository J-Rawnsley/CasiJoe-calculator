# CasiJoe Calculator

## Project description

For this project, I learned some basics of React JS, and challenged myself to build a calculator, implementing all the logic and the user interface from scratch, without following any tutorials or guides. 

This app uses what is known in the world of calculators as "immedate-execution" logic. This means that, if you input a series or numbers and operations without pressing the equals button, each operation is instantly performed and the result displayed, with the next operation being performed on the result of the previous one. I designed the app to behave this way because I wanted it to emulate common hardware calculators used in non-scientific settings. This is in contrast to "formula" logic, in which a series of operations can be built up and calulated all together (subject to the mathematical order of operations) when the user presses equals, as is common in more advanced scientific or software calculators.
    
Just like common hardware calculators, this one will also keep applying the same operation when the equals button is repeatedly pressed.
