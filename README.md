# Casi-Joe Calculator

    For this project, I learned some basics of React JS, and challenged myself to build a calculator without following any tutorials or guides. 
    
    In this app, if you input a sum followed by another operator button (rather than equals), it will calculate and display the answer to the first sum before carrying out the next operation on the result. This is known as 'immediate logic' and is by design, because the app is designed to behave exactly like common hardware calculators used in non-scientific settings. 
    
    Just like common hardware calculators, this one will also keep applying the same operation when the equals button is repeatedly pressed.
